### Principles Section
- "Our Principles"
- "At Estela, our principles are not corporate decorations, they are the soul of why we've stayed small, why our clients stay with us, and why we still answer our own phones after 13 years."

#### Four Core Principles

**1. Truth Over Comfort**
"We tell clients when they don't need new hardware. We admit when we're not the right fit. We share bad news quickly and honestly. If this means losing a sale, so be it. Trust is worth more than any contract."

**2. People Over Profit**
"We've turned down million-dollar projects that didn't align with our values. We've spent weekends helping clients who couldn't afford emergency rates. Because relationships outlast transactions."

**3. Craft Over Speed**
"We could work faster. We choose to work better. Every cable is labeled. Every setting documented. Every solution built to outlast us. Some call it obsessive. Our clients call it essential."

**4. Small Over Scale**
"We are 5 people by choice, not circumstance. We've had offers to grow 10x. We said no. Because we've learned: the magic happens at this size. Your project doesn't get handed off. Your relationship doesn't get 'managed.' You get us. All of us. Always."

#### Key Statistics
- "2 People Left in 13 years"
- "25% Projects Accepted"
