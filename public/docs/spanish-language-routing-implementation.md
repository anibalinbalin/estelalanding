# Spanish Language Routing Implementation

## Overview
Implemented full Spanish language support with automatic routing based on language selection in the navbar.

## Implementation Date
July 8, 2025

## Key Changes

### 1. Navbar Updates (`components/navbar.tsx`)
- Added `getLocalizedPath` helper function to handle language-based routing
- Updated all navigation links to use localized paths
- Desktop menu links now redirect to `/es/` prefixed pages when Spanish is selected
- Mobile menu links also updated with same logic
- Logo link redirects to `/es` when Spanish language is active

### 2. Language Switcher Enhancement (`components/ui/toolbar-switcher.tsx`)
- Added router and pathname imports from Next.js
- Enhanced `toggleLanguage` function to automatically redirect to the Spanish version of the current page
- When switching to Spanish: adds `/es` prefix to current path
- When switching to English: removes `/es` prefix from current path
- Smooth navigation without page reload

### 3. Spanish Route Structure
- Created `/app/es/` directory for Spanish pages
- Added layout file at `/app/es/layout.tsx`
- Spanish infrastructure page at `/app/es/services/infrastructure/page.tsx`

## How It Works

1. **Language Selection**: User clicks the language toggle icon in the navbar
2. **State Update**: Language preference is saved to localStorage
3. **URL Update**: The page automatically redirects to the Spanish version
4. **Content Display**: Spanish content is loaded from the `/es/` route
5. **Navigation**: All navbar links automatically point to Spanish versions

## Example Flow
- User is on `/services/infrastructure` (English)
- User clicks language toggle to switch to Spanish
- Page automatically redirects to `/es/services/infrastructure`
- All navbar links now point to Spanish versions (e.g., `/es/services/security`)
- Content displays in Uruguayan Spanish

## Benefits
- Seamless language switching without manual URL changes
- Consistent navigation experience across languages
- Maintains current page context when switching languages
- SEO-friendly URL structure with language prefix

## Next Steps
1. Create Spanish versions of all remaining pages
2. Consider implementing automatic language detection based on browser settings
3. Add hreflang tags for SEO
4. Implement 404 handling for missing Spanish pages to fallback to English
