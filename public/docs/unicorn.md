# Comprehensive Guide to Applying Effects in Unicorn Studio Scenes (for LLM Context)

This document details the core concepts and techniques for applying effects within Unicorn Studio scenes, drawing directly from the provided sources. It includes nuances and technical considerations relevant for embedding these scenes, particularly in modern web frameworks like Next.js.

## 1. Unicorn Studio Overview

Unicorn.studio allows users to **create stunning WebGL experiences without writing code**. It provides an intuitive, designer-friendly interface to add unique and engaging elements to websites. Creations can be exported as images, videos, or code and **easily embedded into various platforms** including Framer, Webflow, and Wix. The tool works best in **Chrome** and requires **WebGL2 support and hardware acceleration** enabled in the browser.

## 2. Core Concepts for Building Scenes

Understanding the fundamental building blocks is crucial for applying effects effectively:

- **Layers:** Scenes are composed of layers, including **text, shapes, images, and videos**. Layers render in order from **bottom up**.
- **Effects:** Effects are visual manipulations or additions that can be applied to layers. Unicorn Studio offers a large bank of **over 50 different effects** that can be configured with numerous options.
- **Applying Effects:** Effects are added to specific layers. When an effect is applied directly to a layer (like a text layer), it affects only that layer. You can use the dot menu next to a layer in the layer panel to add an effect. Any text layer, shape, or image can have **child effects**.
- **Effect Stacking and Grouping:** Effects can be stacked. By default, an effect placed above another layer (or group of layers) will affect everything underneath it. A useful technique, especially as Unicorn Studio doesn't have native grouping (as of the tutorial date), is to use a **Shape layer to act like a group**. Effects can be added to this shape layer, and then using **blend modes**, the shape layer can manipulate the effects applied _to it_ or the content below it. This allows for stacking multiple effects that apply to content below.
- **Blend Modes:** Blend modes control how layers and effects interact with each other. Examples include **Multiply, Add, and Subtract**. They are essential for achieving specific visual outcomes, such as using a shape as a container for effects and applying them to underlying layers.
- **Configuration Panel:** Layers and effects have a detail panel where you can configure their properties. Effects have configurable options.
- **Responsiveness:** Unicorn Studio supports responsive design. **Relative units** (like for size or font size) can be used to ensure elements scale well with screen size changes. **Anchor points** control how an element's positioning changes as the screen size changes. **Breakpoints** can also be used to change layer or effect properties based on screen sizes.

## 3. Events and Interactivity

Effects and layers can be dynamic through events and interactivity:

- **Events:** Unicorn Studio has three types of events: **Appear, Scroll, and Hover**. These trigger animations or changes to properties.
  - **Appear events** happen when the page loads or when the scene enters the viewport. They allow you to set initial and end values for a property's animation. The timeline helps visualize multiple Appear effects across different layers. Appear events now correctly handle scenes that are scrolled away or tabbed away mid-animation (v1.4.9+).
  - **Scroll events** trigger animations based on the user's scroll position. You can define the start and end scroll positions (e.g., as a percentage of the viewport) for the animation to run.
  - **Hover events** are triggered when the mouse cursor is over the scene or specific elements. This was added in v.1.4.2 for element layers (Images, Shapes, Text). Breakpoint control for events was added in v1.4.7.
- **Interactivity (Mouse Tracking):** Most effects have an **interactivity panel** allowing them to track the mouse in some way. This can affect properties like position, noise patterns, or distortion. You can often choose to **disable touch movement on mobile** for mouse effects. Momentum for mouse trail effects was enabled in v1.4.25. Bugs related to mouse tracking in fixed scenes and mouse tracking getting offset when scrolling were fixed in v1.4.6 and v1.4.23 respectively.

## 4. Embedding Unicorn Studio Scenes

To use a Unicorn Studio scene in a website (including a Next.js application), you need to embed it using the provided SDK.

- **Include the SDK:** Add the Javascript SDK script tag to the `<head>` of your HTML page:
  ```html
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hiunicornstudio/unicornstudio.js@v1.4.25/dist/unicornStudio.umd.js"></script>
  ```
  Alternatively, you can **import it into your component** if using a module bundler:
  ```javascript
  import * as UnicornStudio from "./path/to/unicornStudio.umd.js";
  ```
  _(Note: The specific version in the CDN URL may vary; v1.4.25 is the latest cited)._
- **Initialization Methods:** Scenes can be initialized **inline** or **dynamically**.
  - **Inline:** Add an element with `data-us-project="YOUR_PROJECT_EMBED_ID"`. Replace `"YOUR_PROJECT_EMBED_ID"` with the ID obtained from the "embed" export section in Unicorn Studio. Then, call `UnicornStudio.init()`. This method initializes any element with the `data-us-project` attribute.
  - Alternatively for inline, you can host your own exported JSON file for the scene and use `data-us-project-src="path/to/your/PROJECT_ID.json"` instead of `data-us-project`. **Do not use both** `data-us-project` and `data-us-project-src` on the same element. If hosting your own JSON, remember to **manually update this file** whenever you make changes to the scene in Unicorn Studio.
  - **Dynamically:** Create an element with a unique ID (e.g., `<div id="unicorn"></div>`). Then, use `UnicornStudio.addScene()` with configuration options.
    ```javascript
    UnicornStudio.addScene({
      elementId: "unicorn", // id of the HTML element
      projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_EMBED_ID", // OR filePath: "path/to/your/PROJECT_ID.json"
      // Optional parameters:
      fps: 60, // frames per second (0-120)
      scale: 1, // rendering scale (0.25-1), smaller values = performance boost
      dpi: 1.5, // pixel ratio
      lazyLoad: true, // initialize when scrolls into view
      fixed: false, // explicit control over fixed behavior (added in v1.4.23)
      altText: "Welcome to Unicorn Studio", // text for <canvas> tag (SEO)
      ariaLabel: "This is a canvas scene", // aria-label for <canvas>
      production: false, // when true, hits the global edge CDN
      interactivity: { mouse: { disableMobile: true } }, // disable touch on mobile
    });
    ```
    **Values set in the UI will be overridden** by parameters defined in the `addScene()` configuration. Both `UnicornStudio.init()` and `UnicornStudio.addScene()` return Promises, allowing you to execute code when the scenes are ready.
- **Project ID:** You need to get the **Project Embed ID** from the publish section within Unicorn Studio. You typically publish to a staging link first to see how the scene looks live on your site.
- **Embedding in Framer/Webflow:** The video mentions embedding in Framer using a component link and in Webflow by putting the basic vanilla JavaScript embed directly in a code block. Using an iframe is mentioned as good for testing but **not recommended for production** due to being slower and some events not working.
- **Destroying Scenes:** It is crucial to **destroy scenes** when they are no longer needed, especially in Single Page Applications (SPAs) with dynamic routing (which applies to many Next.js apps).
  - To remove a specific scene instance obtained from `addScene()`, use `scene.destroy()`. `scene.destroy()` now removes the canvas element as expected (v.1.4.9+).
  - To destroy all initialized scenes, use `UnicornStudio.destroy()`. Make sure to call this on unmount in SPAs to prevent memory leaks.
- **Scene Control via SDK:** Once a scene is initialized, you can access properties and methods via the SDK, such as `scene.resize()` to resize the scene if its container changes size, and `scene.paused = true`/`false` to pause/resume the scene (added in v1.4.21+).

## 5. Next.js Specific Considerations ("Nick Picks")

Applying the general embedding principles to a Next.js environment requires paying attention to how Next.js handles rendering:

- **Client-Side Rendering:** Unicorn Studio scenes rely on browser APIs like WebGL2. This code **must only run on the client-side**. When embedding using the SDK's `UnicornStudio.init()` or `addScene()` calls within a React component (as used in Next.js), you should use **dynamic imports** with `ssr: false` to ensure the initialization code is only executed in the browser environment.
- **Cleanup in React Hooks:** In React components (common in Next.js), manage the scene's lifecycle using `useEffect`. Initialize the scene within a `useEffect` hook that runs on mount, and importantly, **implement a cleanup function** within the same `useEffect` to call `scene.destroy()` or `UnicornStudio.destroy()` when the component unmounts or the effect re-runs. This prevents memory leaks, especially when navigating between pages in a Next.js SPA.
- **Performance:**
  - Utilize the `lazyLoad: true` option in `addScene` for scenes not immediately visible on page load.
  - Consider setting `scale` to a value less than 1 for a performance boost if visual quality can be slightly reduced.
  - Ensure the browser supports WebGL2 and has hardware acceleration enabled for optimal performance.
  - Performance enhancements have been made to scene resizing, texture preloading, and mouse tracking over various SDK versions. Downsampling logic has also been made more efficient.
- **Fixed Scenes:** If you use a fixed scene (e.g., a background effect that stays in place while the user scrolls), be aware that the scene's rendering canvas needs to be out of the viewport to be paused for performance savings. You might need to manage its visibility or position (e.g., with CSS) when it's not intended to be seen or interacted with. Bug fixes related to mouse tracking in fixed scenes have been released. The `fixed` parameter was added to explicitly control this behavior (v1.4.23+).
