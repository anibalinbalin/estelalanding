# Service Level Agreements Section Removal

## Task: Remove Service Level Agreements section from service specifications page

### What was done:
- Located the Service Level Agreements section in `components/service-specifications-section.tsx`
- The section starts at line 512 and ends at line 582
- This includes:
  - Section header (lines 512-519)
  - Table with service levels (lines 521-582)
  - Content includes: Availability, Response Time, Resolution Time, Support Hours, On-site Visits, Health Checks, Updates, and Dedicated Engineering columns

### Next step:
- Remove the entire Service Level Agreements section from the component

### What was removed:
Successfully removed the Service Level Agreements section which included:
- Section header "Service Level Agreements"
- Table with 8 rows and 4 columns (Service Level, Essential, Professional, Enterprise)
- Content rows: Availability, Response Time, Resolution Time, Support Hours, On-site Visits, Health Checks, Updates, Dedicated Eng.

### Result:
The section has been successfully deleted from the component. The file now flows directly from the Video Surveillance section to the bottom CTA section.

## Additional Task: Replace Bottom CTA with Protection That Scales With You Section

### What was done:
- Replaced the existing bottom CTA section ("Need a custom configuration?") with the "Protection That Scales With You" section from /services/security
- The new section includes:
  - Vertical line background effect with 30 lines
  - Gradient overlays at top and bottom
  - "Protection That Scales With You" heading
  - CONTACT button with hover effect
  - Responsive design with appropriate breakpoints
  - Dark/light mode support via CSS variables

### Result:
Successfully replaced the bottom CTA section with the more visually appealing "Protection That Scales With You" section that matches the security page design.
