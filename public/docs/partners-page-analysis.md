# Partners Page Analysis

## Overview
The company/partners page was analyzed to determine if it requires the same mobile optimizations as the about and work pages.

## Current Structure
The partners page has a different design pattern:

### 1. Partners List
- Simple vertical list with partner names and partnership dates
- Each partner item has a bottom border divider
- No card-based layout

### 2. Partnership Philosophy Section
- Text-based content sections
- Simple heading and paragraph structure
- No expandable/collapsible elements

## Conclusion
The partners page does not contain:
- ValuesGrid or similar card components
- Elements with double border issues
- Content that would benefit from accordion functionality

Therefore, no modifications are needed for the partners page as it uses a different design pattern that is already optimized for mobile viewing.

## Design Consistency
The partners page maintains its own unique layout that is appropriate for its content type - a simple, readable list format that works well on all screen sizes without requiring interactive elements.
