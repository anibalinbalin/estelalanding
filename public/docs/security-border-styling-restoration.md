# Security Page Border Styling Restoration - CSS Variables Fix

## Overview
After Tailwind cleanup, the security page styling looked "really odd" compared to the backup version. Investigation revealed that critical Oxide design system CSS variables had changed values, affecting the visual appearance across the entire page.

## Root Cause Analysis
Comparison between current and backup versions revealed that critical Oxide design system CSS variables were modified during the cleanup:

### Light Mode Variable Differences:
- **`--content-raise-p3`**: 
  - Current: `#1b1b1b` (lighter gray)
  - Backup: `#08090a` (darker, better contrast)
- **`--stroke-secondary-p3`**: 
  - Current: `#e5e5e5` (solid gray)
  - Backup: `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)` (transparent black overlay)

## Changes Made

### CSS Variables Restored (app/globals.css)
1. **Line 166**: `--content-raise-p3: #08090a;` (was `#1b1b1b`)
2. **Line 174**: `--stroke-secondary-p3: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);` (was `#e5e5e5`)

These variables are used throughout the security page for:
- Text contrast and readability
- Border styling and visual hierarchy
- Surface backgrounds and dividers

## Technical Details

- **Security page files**: Identical between current and backup versions
- **Issue location**: CSS variable definitions in `app/globals.css`
- **Impact**: Affects all Oxide design system styling across the page
- **Variables used**: The security page heavily relies on these variables for proper visual hierarchy

## Files Modified
- `app/globals.css` - Restored CSS variable values

## Verification Required
- Security page styling should now match backup version
- Check other pages using these variables for regressions
- Test both light and dark themes
