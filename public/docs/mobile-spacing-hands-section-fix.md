# Mobile Spacing Fix - Hands Section

## Issue
Excessive vertical spacing between the TestNumbersSection (metrics) and HandsSection on mobile devices, creating a large gap in the layout.

## Root Causes
1. Hand image had `translate-y-[193px]` pushing it down significantly
2. Hands container was positioned at `-translate-y-[26%]` which wasn't optimal for mobile
3. Section had no vertical padding on mobile (`py-0`)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Reduced hand image vertical translation
- Changed from `max-[640px]:translate-y-[193px]` to `max-[640px]:translate-y-[50px]`
- This brought the hand image up by 143px on mobile

### 2. Adjusted hands container positioning
- Changed mobile translate from `-translate-y-[26%]` to `-translate-y-[40%]`
- This shifts the entire hands container upward for better spacing

### 3. Added top padding to HandsSection
- Changed from `py-0 sm:py-32` to `pt-8 pb-0 sm:py-32`
- Added 32px top padding on mobile for visual separation

## Result
The gap between sections has been significantly reduced on mobile while maintaining the desktop layout integrity.

## Files Modified
- `/components/hands-section.tsx`

## Testing
Test on iPhone 12 viewport (390x844) to verify the spacing improvements.
