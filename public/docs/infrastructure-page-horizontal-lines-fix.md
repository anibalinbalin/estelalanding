# Infrastructure Page Horizontal Lines Fix

## Issue
The infrastructure page was missing horizontal lines (borders) between list items in the feature sections. Comparing with the backup, the current version was missing the `border-t` classes that create the visual separation between each list item.

## Solution
Restored the complete infrastructure page content from the backup located at `/Users/anibalin/Sites/anibal6/estela3/my-app-backup-viejo/app/services/infrastructure/page.tsx`.

## Key Elements Restored
- **Horizontal borders**: Each list item now has `border-t border-[var(--stroke-secondary-p3)]` class
- **Complete feature sections**: All three main sections with proper styling
- **Visual separators**: Clean lines between:
  - VMware vSphere environments
  - Bare metal server deployment  
  - Hybrid cloud architectures
  - Load balancing and redundancy
  - Performance monitoring

## Files Modified
- `app/services/infrastructure/page.tsx`: Complete restoration from backup

## Result
The infrastructure page now matches the backup with proper horizontal line separators creating clear visual distinction between each feature list item, exactly as shown in the reference screenshot.
