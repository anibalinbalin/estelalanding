## Resolution Strategy

1. For each file, review both versions of the conflicted content
2. Determine which version to keep or merge appropriately
3. Remove all conflict markers (`<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
4. Test both English and Spanish versions after resolution
5. Ensure consistency between language versions

## Next Steps

1. Start with the Work pages as they have import conflicts that may affect functionality
2. Resolve About page component conflicts, focusing on maintaining translation consistency
3. Fix Team page conflicts in the Spanish version
4. Run build and test all pages after resolution
