# Work Page Values Grid Implementation

## Overview
Applied the same mobile-optimized values grid improvements from the company/about page to the company/work page.

## Changes Made

### 1. ValuesGrid Component Updates
- Applied responsive border styling:
  - Mobile: Subtle 1px border (#e5e5e5 for light, #1b2123 for dark)
  - Desktop: Original borders preserved
- Removed double border effect by eliminating outline classes
- Implemented accordion functionality for mobile with smooth animations

### 2. Page Integration
- Added FinalSection import to work page
- Integrated FinalSection component after WorkProcessList
- FinalSection includes:
  - Image gallery
  - "Our Values" introduction text
  - ValuesGrid component with all 12 values

### 3. Mobile Features
- Expandable/collapsible cards on tap
- Rotating arrow indicator (90° when expanded)
- Smooth height transition animations
- Each card maintains independent open/closed state

### 4. Responsive Behavior
- Mobile (<600px): Accordion interface, single column
- Tablet (600px-999px): Static cards, single column
- Desktop (1000px+): Static cards, 3-column grid

## Testing Results
