# Method Pages Animation Dark Mode Fix

## Issue
The /method/ pages had animation/styling issues in dark mode where dividers between sections were invisible, affecting the visual hierarchy and readability.

## Root Cause
In `/components/method-introduction.tsx`, the divider background color was commented out:
```typescript
const dividerStyle = {
  height: '1px',
  /* backgroundColor: 'var(--border)', */  // ❌ Commented out
  marginBottom: '48px'
}
```

This made the section dividers invisible in dark mode, unlike the backup version where they were properly visible.

## Comparison with Backup
### Backup Version (Working)
- ✅ `backgroundColor: 'var(--border)',` - Active dividers
- Section dividers visible in both light and dark modes
- Proper visual separation between content sections

### Current Version (Before Fix)
- ❌ `/* backgroundColor: 'var(--border)', */` - Commented out dividers
- Section dividers invisible, affecting readability
- Poor visual hierarchy

## Solution Applied
1. **Uncommented the divider background color** in `method-introduction.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   const dividerStyle = {
     height: '1px',
     backgroundColor: 'var(--border)',  // ✅ Restored
     marginBottom: '48px'
   }
   ```

2. **Verified consistency across all method components**:
   - ✅ method-introduction.tsx - Fixed
   - ✅ method-principles.tsx - Already correct
   - ✅ method-implementation.tsx - Already correct  
   - ✅ method-philosophy.tsx - Already correct
   - ✅ method-practices.tsx - Already correct
   - ✅ method-section.tsx - Already correct

## Verification
- All method components now use `backgroundColor: 'var(--border)'` for consistent theming
- Section number circles properly use `backgroundColor: 'var(--step-indicator-p3)'`
- ASCII art backgrounds use `backgroundColor: 'var(--ascii-background-alt-p3)'`
- No hard-coded colors that would break theme switching

## Expected Result
- Section dividers now visible in both light and dark modes
- Improved content readability and visual hierarchy
- Consistent styling across all /method/ pages
- Proper theme support maintained

## Files Modified
- `components/method-introduction.tsx` - Restored divider background color

## Testing Notes
The fix should be immediately visible when:
1. Visiting any /method/ page in dark mode
2. Checking that section dividers are now visible between content blocks
3. Verifying smooth theme switching between light and dark modes
