# Work Page Spacing Consistency

## Overview
Updated the spacing between "Our Approach" and "How We Work" sections on the company/work page to match the existing spacing pattern used between project results and the "Our Approach" section.

## Changes Made

### Files Modified
- `app/company/work/components/WorkApproachList.tsx`

### Specific Change
**Line 142**: Added responsive margin-bottom classes to the WorkApproachList container:
```tsx
// Before:
<div className="m-auto grid max-w-[1200px] grid-cols-[repeat(12,minmax(0,1fr))] gap-6 min-[600px]:gap-6 min-[1000px]:gap-8">

// After (Initial):
<div className="m-auto grid max-w-[1200px] grid-cols-[repeat(12,minmax(0,1fr))] gap-6 min-[600px]:gap-6 min-[1000px]:gap-8 max-[800px]:mb-2 min-[800px]:mb-8">

// After (Corrected):
<div className="m-auto grid max-w-[1200px] grid-cols-[repeat(12,minmax(0,1fr))] gap-6 min-[600px]:gap-6 min-[1000px]:gap-8 max-[800px]:mb-8 min-[800px]:mb-16">
```

## Spacing Analysis
- **Reference pattern**: The space between "✓ Global access for remote teams" and "Our Approach"
- **Visual comparison**: The reference spacing was significantly larger than initially implemented
- **Applied solution**: Updated to `max-[800px]:mb-8 min-[800px]:mb-16` to better match the visual reference

## Result
The spacing between "Our Approach" and "How We Work" sections now matches the visual rhythm established throughout the work page, creating consistent spacing between all major sections.

## Responsive Behavior
- **Mobile (≤800px)**: 32px bottom margin (`mb-8`)
- **Desktop (>800px)**: 64px bottom margin (`mb-16`)

## Iteration Notes
**Initial implementation**: Used `mb-8` (32px) to match ProjectSection margin, but visual comparison showed this was insufficient.

**Corrected implementation**: Increased to `mb-16` (64px) on desktop to better match the reference spacing shown between "✓ Global access for remote teams" and "Our Approach" sections.
