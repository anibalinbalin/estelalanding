# Odiseo Effect Theme Fix

## Issue
The Odiseo effect is showing the light mode code/content when in dark theme, instead of showing the appropriate dark theme version.

## Investigation
Need to find where the Odiseo effect is implemented and how it handles theme switching.

### Components to Check
1. Search for "odiseo" or "Odiseo" in the codebase
2. Check UnicornBackground project IDs
3. Look for any hardcoded theme values

### Root Cause
[To be determined]

### Solution
[To be implemented]

### Testing
- [ ] Odiseo effect shows correct theme content
- [ ] Theme switches properly between light/dark
- [ ] No hardcoded values preventing theme change
