# About Page Relocation - December 27, 2024

## Overview
Moved the `/about` page to `/company/about` to organize company-related pages under a unified structure.

## Changes Made

### 1. File Operations
- **Created**: `/app/company/about/` directory
- **Moved**: `/app/about/page.tsx` → `/app/company/about/page.tsx`
- **Moved**: `/app/about/aboutabout.css` → `/app/company/about/aboutabout.css`
- **Moved**: `/app/about/components/` → `/app/company/about/components/`
- **Deleted**: `/app/about/` directory (including hidden .DS_Store file)

### 2. Components Moved
The following components were moved from `/app/about/components/` to `/app/company/about/components/`:
- `ContentSection.tsx`
- `FinalSection.tsx`
- `HeroSection.tsx`
- `ImagesSection.tsx`
- `PrinciplesList.tsx`
- `TeamSection.tsx`
- `ValuesGrid.tsx`

### 3. Link Updates
Updated all references from `/about` to `/company/about`:

#### navbar.tsx (Line 514)
- **Before**: `<ListItem href="/about" title={t.company.about.title}>`
- **After**: `<ListItem href="/company/about" title={t.company.about.title}>`

#### footer.tsx (Lines 64 and 115)
- **Before**: `{ title: "About", href: "/about" }`
- **After**: `{ title: "About", href: "/company/about" }`
- **Before**: `{ title: "Acerca de", href: "/about" }`
- **After**: `{ title: "Acerca de", href: "/company/about" }`

### 4. URL Structure
- **Before**: About page accessible at `/about`
- **After**: About page accessible at `/company/about`

## Technical Details

### About Page Features
- Modular component architecture with 7 components
- Custom CSS styling (`aboutabout.css`)
- Responsive design
- Multiple sections: Hero, Content, Images, Principles, Team, Values, Final
- Bilingual support (English/Spanish)

### Company Structure
The `/company` directory now contains:
- `/company/about` - Company information and values
- `/company/team` - Team members and principles
- `/company/partners` - Partner information

## Testing
The about page should now be accessible at `/company/about` and maintain all its functionality and styling.

## What Could Be Improved
- **Component Reusability**: Some components in the about page might be reusable across other company pages
- **CSS Organization**: Consider creating a shared CSS file for company pages
- **SEO**: Update any sitemap or meta tags that reference the old `/about` URL
- **Redirects**: Consider adding a redirect from `/about` to `/company/about` for SEO and user experience

## Process Reflection
**What was done**: Successfully relocated the about page to the company structure while updating all internal links.

**What was efficient**: Using file system operations to move entire directories and then updating links in a systematic way.

**What could be better**: Could have checked for any hardcoded links in the moved components themselves, though the search didn't reveal any.

**How to test**: 
1. Visit `/company/about` to verify the page loads correctly
2. Check that all navigation links (navbar and footer) point to the new location
3. Verify all components and styling are intact
4. Test the old `/about` URL returns a 404 (expected behavior)
