# Navbar Menu Display Issue

## Problem
On the services/consulting page, the navigation menu items in the "SERVICES" dropdown are not fully displayed - they appear truncated or cut off.

## Observed Issue
- Menu items like "INFRASTRUCTURE", "SECURITY", "DEVELOPMENT" are not showing completely
- This appears to be a CSS overflow, z-index, or positioning issue
- The problem is specific to the services pages

## Investigation Areas
1. Navbar component styling and positioning
2. Services page layout that might be interfering
3. Dropdown menu z-index and overflow settings
4. Any page-specific CSS that might be conflicting

## Root Cause
The navigation menu dropdown was being clipped due to:
1. **Z-index conflicts**: Both navbar and navigation viewport used `z-50`, creating stacking context issues
2. **Overflow clipping**: NavigationMenuViewport had `overflow-hidden` which clipped dropdown content
3. **Insufficient z-index hierarchy**: Menu content wasn't appearing above page elements

## Solution
Fixed by implementing a multi-layer approach:

### 1. Increased Z-index Hierarchy
- Changed NavigationMenuViewport z-index from `z-50` to `z-[9999]`
- This ensures dropdown appears above all page content

### 2. Added CSS Overrides in globals.css
```css
/* Fix navigation menu viewport clipping */
[data-slot="navigation-menu-viewport"] {
  overflow: visible !important;
  z-index: 9999 !important;
}

/* Ensure navigation menu wrapper has proper z-index */
[data-radix-navigation-menu-viewport] {
  z-index: 9999 !important;
}
```

### 3. Files Modified
- `/components/ui/navigation-menu.tsx` - Updated NavigationMenuViewport z-index
- `/app/globals.css` - Added CSS overrides for proper display

## Testing
- [x] Menu displays fully on services/consulting page
- [x] No truncation of menu items
- [x] Menu functions correctly across all pages
- [x] High z-index ensures dropdown appears above all content
- [x] Overflow visible prevents clipping of menu content
