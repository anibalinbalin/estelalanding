# CONTEXT OF METHOD - The Estela Method

This document provides a comprehensive overview of The Estela Method as implemented across the `/method` section of the Estela website.

## Overview

**Main Title:** The Estela Method  
**Subtitle:** Technology Integration with Soul  
**URL Structure:** `/method`

**Core Philosophy:**  
"There is a lost art of building technology systems that actually work for people. To bring back the human element, these are the foundational ideas that guide everything we do at Estela."

## Method Structure & Navigation

The Estela Method is organized into 5 main sections with numbered subsections:

### 1. Introduction (1.1)
**URL:** `/method/introduction`  
**Title:** The Art of Translation  
**Section Number:** 1.1

**Key Themes:**
- Translation between technology and humanity
- Hermes as messenger between divine and mortal realms
- The lost art of making technology invisible
- Technology should adapt to people, not the other way around

**Content Sections:**
- The Lost Art
- The Translation Imperative  
- Our Translation Philosophy (Technical to Practical, Complex to Simple, Problem to Solution, Present to Future)
- The Method Emerges
- What This Means for You
- The Journey Ahead

**Core Message:** "Like Hermes translating between gods and mortals, we translate between technology and humanity."

### 2. Principles (2.1 - 2.5)
**URL:** `/method/principles`  
**Title:** Core Principles

The five foundational principles that guide all Estela work:

#### 2.1 Small Teams, Deep Impact
- Stay at 5 people by choice, not limitation
- Research proves it, experience confirms it
- Senior engineers, not interns
- Direct communication, not telephone games

#### 2.2 Technology Serves People  
- Don't implement technology for technology's sake
- Every element must improve someone's day
- If it doesn't make work easier, we don't build it

#### 2.3 Built to Last, Designed to Evolve
- Build foundations that grow with you
- No Band-Aids or quick fixes
- Real solutions that work today and adapt tomorrow

#### 2.4 Radical Transparency
- No black boxes, vendor lock-in, or mysteries
- Clients understand what we build and how it works
- Full knowledge transfer and maintainability

#### 2.5 The Beauty of Simplicity
- Like a well-composed painting, nothing extra
- Every element has purpose
- Complexity is the enemy of reliability

### 3. Implementation (3.1 - 3.4)
**URL:** `/method/implementation`  
**Title:** How We Work

The four-phase implementation approach:

#### 3.1 Understanding Phase (1-2 weeks)
- Don't start with solutions, start with questions
- Shadow your team for a day
- Map actual workflows (not ideal ones)
- Identify pain points and possibilities
- Document everything

#### 3.2 Architecture Phase (1-2 weeks)
- Design the system that fits your reality
- Create detailed blueprints
- Plan for today and tomorrow
- Choose tools that talk to each other
- Design for your team's skill level

#### 3.3 Implementation Phase (2-8 weeks depending on scope)
- Build without breaking what works
- Staged rollouts, no big bangs
- Test with real users, not scenarios
- Document as we build
- Train as we go

#### 3.4 Evolution Phase (Ongoing)
- Technology is never "done"
- Regular health checks
- Proactive improvements
- Continuous education
- Grow with your needs

### 4. Practices (4.1 - 4.5)
**URL:** `/method/practices`  
**Title:** Our Practices  
**Section Number:** 4

**Subtitle:** "Daily operational excellence through proven methods and consistent execution."

The five operational practices that ensure consistent service delivery:

#### 4.1 The 24-Hour Rule
- Every critical issue gets a response within 24 hours
- Not an auto-reply - a real person who knows your system
- Problems compound with time; early response prevents escalation
- **How It Works:** Issue tracking, engineer assignment (2hrs), diagnosis plan (24hrs), clear communication, post-incident review
- Focus on response time, not necessarily resolution time

#### 4.2 Documentation as Art  
- Create documentation people actually read
- Visual, clear, useful - no 500-page PDFs gathering dust
- Traditional IT docs prioritize completeness over clarity
- **Our Approach:** Visual diagrams, quick reference guides, video walkthroughs, searchable knowledge base, regular updates
- Answers three questions: What does this do? How do I use it? What if something goes wrong?

#### 4.3 The Weekly Pulse
- Short, regular check-ins keep systems healthy
- 15 minutes can prevent 15 hours of downtime
- Catch whispers before they become screams
- **Weekly Routine:** Monday health reports, Wednesday review calls, optimization recommendations, trend analysis, action items
- Maintain rhythm of attention for proactive maintenance

#### 4.4 Vendor Relationships
- Direct relationships with Lenovo, UniFi, Synology, SentinelOne
- Your problems become our problems - no runaround
- Traditional vendor triangle of frustration eliminated
- **Direct Approach:** Named contacts, direct escalation paths, technical briefings, beta access, guaranteed response times
- Years of relationship building save hours during problems

#### 4.5 Knowledge Transfer
- Don't create dependency - create capability
- Your team learns to fish, not just eat
- Opposite of companies that profit from client ignorance
- **Transfer Methods:** Hands-on training, lunch-and-learns, reference materials, escalation procedures, capability assessments
- Free both parties to focus on strategic improvements vs. routine maintenance

### 5. Philosophy (5.1 - 5.4)
**URL:** `/method/philosophy` (Referenced but not yet implemented)

The deeper philosophical foundations:

#### 5.1 The Hexagon Principle
#### 5.2 Learning from History
#### 5.3 The Art Connection
#### 5.4 Results, Not Reports

## Design & Styling

**Theme:** Linear-inspired dark theme
- Background: `rgb(8, 9, 10)`
- Primary text: `rgb(215, 216, 217)`
- Secondary text: `rgb(126, 131, 133)`

**Typography:**
- Body text: SuisseIntl font family
- Labels/breadcrumbs: GT_America_Mono (monospace)
- Coherent title sizing with main site (2.5rem-3.25rem)

**Navigation Pattern:**
- Breadcrumb navigation using GT_America_Mono
- Previous/Next links between sections
- Numbered sections (1.1, 2.1-2.5, 3.1-3.4, etc.)

## Core Message Summary

The Estela Method represents a comprehensive approach to technology implementation that prioritizes human needs over technical complexity. It emphasizes small teams, transparent processes, and solutions that evolve with businesses rather than constraining them. The method serves as both a practical framework and a philosophical statement about how technology should serve humanity.
