# Double Navbar Investigation

## Issue Description
The page at http://localhost:3000/aboutabout is displaying two navbars instead of one.

## Investigation Plan
1. Check the route structure for /aboutabout
2. Examine layout.tsx for navbar placement
3. Look for navbar components in page components
4. Identify if there's a nested layout causing duplication
5. Create test-driven solution

## Progress
- [x] Route structure analysis
- [x] Layout hierarchy examination  
- [x] Component inspection
- [x] Root cause identification
- [x] Solution implementation
- [ ] Testing and verification

## Findings

### Root Cause Identified ✓
The double navbar issue is caused by:

1. **Layout.tsx (line 32)**: Contains `<Navbar />` component that renders on ALL pages
2. **aboutabout/page.tsx (line 20)**: Also contains `<Navbar />` component explicitly imported and rendered

This creates two navbar instances:
- One from the root layout (appears on all pages)
- One from the page component itself (redundant)

### Code Analysis
- `app/layout.tsx:32` renders navbar globally
- `app/aboutabout/page.tsx:20` renders navbar locally
- Both use the same `@/components/navbar` component

## Solution
Remove the redundant `<Navbar />` from the aboutabout page component since the root layout already provides it globally.

### Implementation ✓
1. Removed `import { Navbar } from '@/components/navbar';` from aboutabout/page.tsx
2. Removed `<Navbar />` component from the JSX return in aboutabout/page.tsx
3. Kept the root layout navbar intact to maintain global navigation

### Changes Made
- File: `app/aboutabout/page.tsx`
  - Line 4: Removed Navbar import
  - Lines 19-20: Removed redundant `<Navbar />` component

The page now relies solely on the navbar provided by the root layout at `app/layout.tsx:32`.
