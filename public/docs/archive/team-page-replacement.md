# Team Page Replacement - December 27, 2024

## Overview
Replaced the existing `/company/team` page with the new team page that was previously located at `/newteam`.

## Changes Made

### 1. File Operations
- **Deleted**: `/app/company/team/page.tsx` (old team page)
- **Moved**: `/app/newteam/page.tsx` → `/app/company/team/page.tsx`
- **Moved**: `/app/newteam/aboutabout.css` → `/app/company/team/aboutabout.css`
- **Moved**: `/app/newteam/components/` → `/app/company/team/components/`
- **Deleted**: `/app/newteam/` directory (after moving all contents)

### 2. Components Moved
The following components were moved from `/app/newteam/components/` to `/app/company/team/components/`:
- `ContentSection.tsx`
- `FinalSection.tsx`
- `HeroSection.tsx`
- `PrinciplesList.tsx`
- `TeamGrid.tsx`
- `TeamSection.tsx`
- `ValuesGrid.tsx`

### 3. URL Structure
- **Before**: Team page accessible at `/newteam`
- **After**: Team page accessible at `/company/team`
- **No link updates needed**: All existing links pointing to `/company/team` continue to work

## Technical Details

### Old Team Page Features
- Simple React component with inline team data
- Basic styling with Tailwind CSS
- Team members grid with images
- Principles and benefits sections

### New Team Page Features
- Modular component architecture
- Custom CSS styling (`aboutabout.css`)
- Enhanced visual design
- Footer integration
- Tracking elements for analytics
- Responsive design improvements

## Testing
The new team page should be accessible at `/company/team` and maintain all the enhanced features from the previous `/newteam` implementation.

## What Could Be Improved
- **Component Organization**: The components could be moved to a shared location if they're reused elsewhere
- **CSS Naming**: The `aboutabout.css` file could be renamed to something more descriptive like `team.css`
- **Image Optimization**: Consider using Next.js Image component for better performance
- **Component Testing**: Add unit tests for the new components

## Process Reflection
**What was done**: Successfully replaced the team page by moving files and directories while preserving the URL structure.

**What was efficient**: Using file system operations to move entire directories and files at once.

**What could be better**: Could have checked for any import paths that might need updating after moving components.

**How to test**: Visit `/company/team` to verify the new page loads correctly with all its components and styling.
