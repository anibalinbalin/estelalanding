# NewWork Page Final Section Removal

## Date: December 29, 2024

## Summary
Removed the final call-to-action section from the `/newwork` page as requested.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified `/app/newwork/page.tsx`
- Removed the `<WorkFinalSection />` component from the page
- Removed the import statement for `WorkFinalSection`

### Components Affected
- **Removed from rendering**: `WorkFinalSection` component
- **File still exists**: `/app/newwork/components/WorkFinalSection.tsx` (not deleted, only removed from page)

### Content Removed
The following content was removed from the page:
- "Ready to start your transformation?" heading
- "Every great project starts with a conversation." subheading
- Two CTA buttons: "Start Your Project" and "View Our Services"
- Italic text: "Every project is a partnership. Every outcome is measured. Every solution is built to last."

## Testing
- Verify the `/newwork` page loads without errors
- Confirm the final section with CTAs is no longer displayed
- Check that the page ends after the Work Process section

## Notes
- The `WorkFinalSection.tsx` component file was not deleted, only its usage was removed
- This allows for easy restoration if needed in the future
