# Team Grid Adaptation for /newteam Page

## Overview
This document outlines the adaptation of the `/newteam` page to replace the company values grid with team member photos and information.

## Changes Made

### 1. Component Structure
- **Replaced**: `ValuesGrid` component with `TeamGrid` component
- **Location**: `/app/newteam/components/TeamGrid.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Display team member photos instead of company values

### 2. Team Member Data
**Source**: Extracted from `/app/company/team/page.tsx` lines 41-67

**Team Members**:
1. **Peter Johnson** - Co-founder, CEO
2. **Aníbal Barrera** - Founder & Technical Director  
3. **Alfonso Martinez** - Co-founder, CTO
4. **Nahuel Rodriguez** - Head of Engineering
5. **Pablo Garcia** - Head of Product
6. **Diego Echain** - Head of Economy

### 3. Grid Layout Preservation
- **Maintained**: Same 12-column responsive grid system
- **Responsive breakpoints**: 
  - Mobile: `col-span-12`
  - Tablet: `min-[600px]:col-start-[2] min-[600px]:col-span-10`
  - Desktop: `min-[1000px]:col-span-4` (3 columns of team members)

### 4. Design Adaptations
- **Card Design**: Simplified from accordion-style value cards to clean team member cards
- **Card Shape**: Square aspect ratio (`aspect-square`) to match the square profile photos
- **Image Sizing**: 88px x 88px profile images with rounded corners
- **Layout**: Centered content with `justify-center` for optimal vertical alignment
- **Spacing**: Reduced padding from `p-6` to `p-5` to fit content within square bounds
- **Theme Support**: Maintained light/dark theme compatibility
- **Typography**: Consistent with existing design system

### 5. Responsive Behavior
- **Mobile**: Single column layout with full-width square cards
- **Tablet**: Centered 10-column layout with square cards
- **Desktop**: 3-column grid showing team members side by side in square cards

## Files Modified
1. `/app/newteam/components/TeamGrid.tsx` - New component
2. `/app/newteam/page.tsx` - Updated imports and component usage

## Technical Details
- **Framework**: Next.js 15.3.2 with React 19
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables
- **Theme**: next-themes integration maintained
- **Images**: External URLs from Linear assets (existing team photos)
