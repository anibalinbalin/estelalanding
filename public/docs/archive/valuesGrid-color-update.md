# ValuesGrid Color Update

## Objective
Update the ValuesGrid component to use #1c2225 color for h3 headings and border-bottom styling in dark theme.

## Files Found
1. `/app/about/components/ValuesGrid.tsx` - Main component with theme handling
2. `/app/aboutabout/components/ValuesGrid.tsx` - Alternative version without theme handling

## Current State Analysis
- The main ValuesGrid component has theme handling with useTheme hook
- h3 elements have hard-coded border color: `border-b-[#eaeaea]` (line 70)
- h3 text color is hard-coded to `text-[#f5b944]` (line 70)
- The component needs conditional styling for dark theme

## Changes Required
1. Update border-bottom color to use #1c2225 in dark theme
2. Update h3 text color to use #1c2225 in dark theme
3. Ensure light theme styling remains unchanged

## Implementation Plan
1. Modify the main ValuesGrid component with proper theme-based styling
2. Update the secondary ValuesGrid component if needed
3. Test the changes in both light and dark themes

## Changes Made

### 1. `/app/about/components/ValuesGrid.tsx`
- Updated h3 element styling to use conditional classes based on theme
- Light theme: `text-[#f5b944] border-b-[#eaeaea]` (unchanged)
- Dark theme: `text-[#1c2225] border-b-[#1c2225]` (new)

### 2. `/app/aboutabout/components/ValuesGrid.tsx`
- Added theme handling imports: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useTheme`
- Added theme logic to the main component
- Updated ValueCard component to accept `currentTheme` prop
- Applied the same conditional styling for h3 elements

## What Was Done
1. **Theme Detection**: Both components now properly detect the current theme using `useTheme` hook
2. **Conditional Styling**: h3 elements now have theme-based styling using template literals
3. **Consistent Approach**: Both ValuesGrid components now follow the same pattern for theme handling
4. **Preserved Light Theme**: Light theme colors remain unchanged (#f5b944 for text, #eaeaea for border)
5. **Dark Theme Update**: Dark theme now uses #1c2225 for both text and border-bottom

## How to Test
1. Visit the about page in both light and dark themes
2. Verify that h3 headings ("Candor", "Courage", etc.) display in #1c2225 color in dark theme
3. Verify that border-bottom under h3 headings uses #1c2225 color in dark theme
4. Verify that light theme styling remains unchanged
5. Check responsive behavior on different screen sizes (min-[1000px] breakpoint)

## Technical Notes
- The styling only applies to desktop view (min-[1000px]:block)
- Mobile view uses a different accordion-style layout that wasn't modified
- Theme detection includes proper hydration handling to prevent SSR mismatches
