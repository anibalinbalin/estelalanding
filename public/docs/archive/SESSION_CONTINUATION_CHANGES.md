# Session Continuation Changes

## 2025-05-31

### ESLint Fixes
- **Fixed unused imports in services pages**
  - `/app/services/infrastructure/page.tsx`: Removed unused `NetworkIcon` and `ServerIcon` imports
  - `/app/services/security/page.tsx`: Removed unused `ShieldIcon`, `KeyIcon`, and `MonitorIcon` imports
  
- **Fixed React unescaped entities**
  - `/app/services/security/page.tsx`: Changed apostrophes from `'` to `&apos;` in "Protection isn't paranoia. It's preparation."

### Code Quality Status
- ✅ ESLint errors resolved (only 1 warning remains about img vs Image component in customers-section.tsx)
- ✅ Security page structure is complete and comprehensive
- ✅ Infrastructure page structure is complete and functional
- ✅ Both pages follow established patterns from the codebase

### Current Page Status

#### Security Services Page (`/app/services/security/page.tsx`)
- **Status**: ✅ Complete and fully implemented
- **Features**:
  - Comprehensive breadcrumb navigation
  - Hero section with "Protection isn't paranoia. It's preparation." tagline
  - Core services sections with ASCII diagrams:
    - Endpoint Protection & EDR
    - Cloud Security Posture Management
    - Physical Security Systems
  - Additional services grid (Network Security, SIEM & SOC, Identity Management, Vulnerability Management)
  - Multiple feature sections (Cloud Security & Automation, Security Monitoring & Analytics, Compliance & Risk Management, Security Architecture & Best Practices)
  - CTA sections with consistent "oxide-nav-button" styling
  - Detailed specifications table
  - Emergency contact information

#### Infrastructure Services Page (`/app/services/infrastructure/page.tsx`)
- **Status**: ✅ Complete and fully implemented
- **Features**:
  - Comprehensive breadcrumb navigation
  - Hero section with "The foundation of everything digital" tagline
  - Core services sections with ASCII diagrams:
    - Enterprise Network Architecture (UniFi deployment)
    - Server Infrastructure (VMware virtualization)
  - Additional services grid (Storage Solutions, Structured Cabling, Wireless Networks, Network Security)
  - Real-world case study of architecture firm transformation
  - CTA sections with consistent button styling
  - Contact information

### Technical Implementation
- Both pages follow the established patterns:
  - Next.js 15.3.2 with TypeScript
  - Responsive design with breakpoints (min-[600px], min-[800px], min-[1000px])
  - Consistent container structure (`w-full px-5 min-[600px]:px-10`)
  - ASCII art diagrams in monospace containers
  - Lucide React icons for consistent iconography
  - "oxide-nav-button" components for CTAs
  - Proper semantic HTML structure

### Summary
The security and infrastructure service pages are both complete and fully functional. The session continuation involved only minor ESLint cleanup and no functional changes were needed. Both pages implement comprehensive service offerings with:

1. **Professional presentation** with proper breadcrumbs, hero sections, and CTAs
2. **Technical diagrams** using ASCII art to visualize architectures
3. **Detailed service descriptions** with feature lists and benefits
4. **Real-world examples** and case studies where appropriate
5. **Consistent styling** following the established design system
6. **Responsive design** working across all device sizes

The implementation follows all the patterns established in the codebase and maintains consistency with the Estela brand and design system.
