# Odiseus Theme Switching Fix

## Issue Found
The Odiseus effect in `DeveloperVelocitySection` is not properly switching between light and dark themes because:
1. It only changes the `data-us-project` attribute without reinitializing Unicorn Studio
2. Unicorn Studio doesn't react to attribute changes after initialization
3. The component lacks proper cleanup and reinitialization logic

## Location
- **Component**: `/components/developer-velocity-section.tsx`
- **Lines**: 104-118
- **Light theme project**: `bJ8ClYm9Acq6hsxeaXbl`
- **Dark theme project**: `oMxsDGc8LOPLjsXIahO4` (Odiseus)

## Solution
Apply the same pattern used in `UnicornBackground` component:
1. Add a `key` prop based on theme to force re-render
2. Implement proper cleanup and reinitialization
3. Add production mode parameter for better performance

## Changes Implemented
1. ✅ Added `key={resolvedTheme}` prop to force re-render when theme changes
2. ✅ Added `?production=true` parameter to both project IDs for better performance
3. The key prop ensures the component is completely re-rendered when theme changes, which triggers a fresh initialization of the Unicorn Studio effect

## Testing Instructions
1. Navigate to a page that shows the DeveloperVelocitySection
2. Toggle between light and dark themes
3. Verify that:
   - Light theme shows the original effect (project: bJ8ClYm9Acq6hsxeaXbl)
   - Dark theme shows the Odiseus effect (project: oMxsDGc8LOPLjsXIahO4)
   - The effect properly reinitializes when switching themes
