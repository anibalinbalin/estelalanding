# Unicorn Studio Background Implementation Analysis

## Current Implementation Details

### 1. Component Location
- **File**: `/components/ui/unicorn-background.tsx`
- **Type**: Client-side React component using hooks

### 2. Key Features
- **Theme Support**: Uses two different Unicorn Studio projects for light/dark themes
  - Light theme project ID: `hzCHR7pkfaINHqE3pmvN`
  - Dark theme project ID: `7oGZViIlL09cikCTRaRM`
- **SDK Version**: v1.4.25 loaded from CDN
- **Loading Method**: Dynamic script injection
- **Initialization**: Managed through a custom `isInitialized` flag

### 3. Current Issues Identified

#### a) Production Mode Not Enabled
The component is NOT using the `production: true` parameter, which means:
- It's hitting the staging API instead of the global edge CDN
- Slower performance and potentially less reliable in production
- Not optimized for production usage

#### b) Missing SDK Parameters
Several optimization parameters are not being used:
- `fps`: Not set (defaults to 60)
- `scale`: Not set (could be lowered for performance)
- `dpi`: Not set
- `lazyLoad`: Not implemented
- `interactivity`: Mouse tracking not configured for mobile

#### c) Potential Memory Leak
- The component calls `UnicornStudio.init()` on theme changes
- It attempts cleanup with `destroy()` but the implementation might not fully clean up
- Re-initialization on theme change may cause issues

#### d) Theme Switching Issues
- When theme changes, the component re-initializes the entire Unicorn Studio SDK
- This could cause flickering or performance issues
- The `data-us-project` attribute is changed dynamically, but the SDK might not handle this properly

### 4. Usage
- Used in `/components/ui/animated-hero.tsx`
- Positioned as an absolute background element with z-index -10
- Has a fixed minimum height of 900px

## Recommendations for Fixes

### 1. Enable Production Mode
Add `production: true` to the initialization to use the global edge CDN.

### 2. Implement Proper Scene Management
Instead of re-initializing the entire SDK, use the `addScene()` method for better control.

### 3. Add Performance Optimizations
- Set appropriate `fps` (consider 30 for backgrounds)
- Use `scale: 0.75` for performance boost
- Implement `lazyLoad: true` if the hero isn't immediately visible

### 4. Fix Theme Switching
- Destroy and recreate scenes properly on theme change
- Consider using a single scene with dynamic styling instead of two different projects

### 5. Add Mobile Optimizations
Configure mouse interactivity to be disabled on mobile devices for better performance.

### 6. Implement Proper Cleanup
Ensure proper cleanup in the useEffect return function to prevent memory leaks in SPA navigation.
