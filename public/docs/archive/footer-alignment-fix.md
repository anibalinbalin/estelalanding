# Footer Alignment Fix

## Date: December 29, 2024

## Summary
Fixed the alignment issue in the footer where the tagline/description text was not aligned with the navigation column headers (SERVICES, METHOD, COMPANY).

## Problem
The "Guiding businesses through technological transformations..." text in the footer's left column was positioned too low and not aligned with the navigation section headers on the right side.

## Solution

### Changes Made to `/components/footer.tsx`:

1. **Restructured the Company Info Section**:
   - Separated the logo into its own container with `mb-8` margin
   - Created a new flex container for the content that needs to align with nav headers
   - Moved the description paragraph to align with navigation headers

2. **Layout Structure**:
   ```
   Before: Logo and description were in nested flex containers
   After:  Logo is separate, description aligns with nav headers
   ```

3. **Fine-tuning**:
   - Added `marginTop: '-0.125rem'` to the description paragraph for precise alignment
   - Maintained the gap between description and address/contact sections

## Visual Result
- The tagline text now starts at the same vertical position as the navigation headers
- The logo remains above the content
- Address and contact information remain below with appropriate spacing

## Testing
- Verify alignment on desktop viewports (800px and above)
- Check that mobile layout still works correctly
- Ensure hover states and links function properly
