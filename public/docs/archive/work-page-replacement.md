# Work Page Replacement Process

## Date: 2025-06-29

## Overview
Successfully replaced the `/work` page with the content and structure from `/newwork`, providing enhanced work showcase functionality with improved SVG styling and theme support.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Page Structure Replacement**
- **File:** `/app/work/page.tsx`
- **Before:** Simple component using `WorkSection` from components
- **After:** Complete work showcase with project sections, hero, and approach/process lists

### 2. **Key Features Added**
- **Project Showcase:** 4 detailed case studies with:
  - Hospital Network Infrastructure
  - Smart Manufacturing Platform
  - Financial Services Security
  - Cloud Migration & Modernization
- **Dynamic Project Images:** Using Oxide Computer design assets
- **Work Approach List:** SVG icons with theme-aware styling
- **Work Process List:** Numbered workflow steps
- **Hero Section:** Professional work page introduction

### 3. **Component Dependencies**
All components reference `/newwork/components/` directory:
- `HeroSection` - Work page hero with messaging
- `ProjectSection` - Individual project case study display
- `ProjectImagesSection` - Project image galleries
- `WorkApproachList` & `WorkProcessList` - Methodology sections with SVG styling

### 4. **Styling Integration**
- Imports `../newwork/aboutabout.css` for consistent styling
- Uses Oxide Computer design system CSS variables
- Maintains theme-aware SVG icons with yellow color (#f5b944)
- Responsive design with mobile/desktop breakpoints

### 5. **Route References Updated**
- **Services/Consulting Page:** Updated link from `/company/work` to `/work`
- **Navigation/Footer:** Already correctly pointing to `/work` (no changes needed)

## Technical Implementation

### Import Structure
```tsx
import { HeroSection } from '../newwork/components/HeroSection';
import { ProjectSection } from '../newwork/components/ProjectSection';
import { ProjectImagesSection } from '../newwork/components/ProjectImagesSection';
import { WorkApproachList, WorkProcessList } from '../newwork/components/WorkApproachList';
import '../newwork/aboutabout.css';
```

### Project Data Structure
Each project includes:
- `id`, `title`, `client`, `year`, `category`, `duration`
- `challenge`, `solution`, `technologies`, `results`
- `testimonial` for social proof

### Theme Integration
- Uses `'use client'` directive for client-side theme detection
- Maintains consistency with existing theme system
- SVG icons properly styled for light/dark themes

## Benefits

1. **Enhanced User Experience:**
   - Detailed case studies with real project data
   - Professional project showcase format
   - Responsive design across all devices

2. **Improved Design Consistency:**
   - Matches existing site design patterns
   - Proper theme support throughout
   - Professional Oxide Computer aesthetic

3. **Better Content Organization:**
   - Clear methodology sections
   - Structured project information
   - Easy navigation and scanning

## Testing Notes

- Page renders correctly with all components
- Theme switching works properly
- Navigation links function as expected
- Mobile responsiveness maintained
- CSS styling properly applied

## Future Considerations

1. **Performance:** Consider moving newwork components to shared location
2. **Maintenance:** Components are still in `/newwork/` directory
3. **Content:** Project data could be moved to external data source
4. **Images:** Consider optimizing project images for better performance
