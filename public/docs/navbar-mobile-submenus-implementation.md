# Navbar Mobile Submenus Implementation

## Overview
Implementing collapsible submenus for the mobile hamburger menu navigation, based on the Oxide reference implementation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Mobile Menu Structure
- Added accordion-style collapsible sections for Services, Method, and Company menus
- Implemented expand/collapse functionality with arrow indicators
- Added proper state management for each submenu section

### 2. Mobile Menu Features
- Each main menu item with submenus shows an arrow indicator
- Clicking on menu items toggles the submenu visibility
- Smooth animations for expanding/collapsing submenus
- Proper styling to match the desktop navigation hierarchy

### 3. State Management
- Added separate state for each submenu section (services, method, company)
- Ensures only one submenu can be open at a time (optional)
- Maintains proper state reset when mobile menu is closed

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows the pattern from the Oxide reference:
- Uses button elements for expandable menu items
- Includes SVG arrow indicators that rotate on expand/collapse
- Maintains consistent styling with the existing navbar design
- Preserves all translation support for multi-language functionality

## Testing Notes
- Tested on iPhone 12 viewport (390x844)
- Verified all submenus expand and collapse correctly
- Confirmed navigation links work properly
- Checked theme switching and language support

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Collapsible Submenus**: Each main navigation item (Services, Method, Company) now has an expandable/collapsible submenu on mobile
2. **Visual Indicators**: Arrow icons that rotate 90 degrees when a submenu is expanded
3. **State Management**: Added separate state variables for each submenu (mobileServicesOpen, mobileMethodOpen, mobileCompanyOpen)
4. **Auto-close on Navigation**: All submenus and the main mobile menu close when a user clicks on any navigation link
5. **Clean State Reset**: When the hamburger menu is closed, all submenu states are reset to closed

## Implementation Complete
The mobile navigation now provides full access to all submenu items, matching the desktop navigation hierarchy while maintaining a mobile-friendly interface.
