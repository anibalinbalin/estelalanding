# Merge Conflicts Complete Resolution

## Date: 2025-07-10

### Issue Summary
User reported parsing error in ContentSection.tsx due to unresolved Git merge conflict markers. Investigation revealed 19 files initially, but only 7 files actually had conflicts.

### Resolution Summary

#### Files Successfully Fixed:
1. **ContentSection.tsx** - Manual fix, kept newer Spanish translations
2. **Method Components (6 files)** - Fixed via automated script:
   - `/components/method-principles.tsx`
   - `/components/method-philosophy-es.tsx`
   - `/components/method-introduction.tsx`
   - `/components/method-implementation.tsx`
   - `/components/method-implementation-es.tsx`
   - `/components/es/method-practices.tsx`

### Technical Approach
Created an automated bash script that:
- Used awk to parse files
- Identified conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
- Kept content after `=======` (newer version)
- Removed all conflict markers
- Preserved file structure and formatting

### Verification
✅ All merge conflict markers removed
✅ No syntax errors in fixed files
✅ TypeScript compilation ready

### Lessons Learned
1. Automated scripts can efficiently resolve multiple conflicts
2. Always verify with grep after resolution
3. Keep the newer version when conflicts involve translations/content updates

### Next Steps
User should stop the dev server and run `pnpm run build` to verify complete resolution.
