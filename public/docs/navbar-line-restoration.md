# Navbar Line Restoration

## Summary
Restored the subtle grey line at the bottom of the navbar that was previously removed during a redesign.

## Problem
The navbar used to have a subtle grey line at the bottom that provided visual separation between the navigation and the page content. This line was inadvertently removed during previous refactoring.

## Solution
Added back the missing line element:
```tsx
<div className="h-[1px] w-full border-b border-border absolute bottom-0"></div>
```

## Implementation Details
- **Location**: Added to `components/navbar.tsx` at line 236
- **Positioning**: Absolutely positioned at the bottom of the navbar container
- **Styling**: Uses `border-border` CSS variable for theme-aware coloring
- **Dimensions**: 1px height, full width
- **Theme Support**: Automatically adapts to light/dark themes through CSS variables

## Theme Colors
- **Light Mode**: `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08)` - subtle dark line
- **Dark Mode**: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08)` - subtle light line

## Testing Performed
- ✅ Visual verification in development server
- ✅ Confirmed line appears in both light and dark themes
- ✅ No linting errors introduced
- ✅ Server continues to run without issues

## Files Modified
- `components/navbar.tsx`: Added grey line element

## Git Reference
Original line was removed in commit `70e436a` (Major website redesign), restored in this session.

## Notes
This is a simple visual enhancement that improves the overall design hierarchy and visual separation between the navbar and page content.
