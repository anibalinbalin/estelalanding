# Complete Technology Solutions Background Fix

## Issue
The animation backgrounds in the "Complete Technology Solutions" section on the main page were using incorrect colors in dark mode. Instead of the intended `#39301f`, they were showing as darker/different colors.

## Root Cause
The containers for the ASCII animations were using CSS classes `bg-gradient-to-b from-muted/50 to-muted` which relied on CSS variables that didn't match the intended design color.

## Solution
**Targeted Fix**: Updated only the specific animation containers in the "Complete Technology Solutions" section to use the correct hardcoded background color `#39301f`.

**Files Modified:**
- `components/features-11.tsx` - Updated three animation container backgrounds

**Changes Made:**
1. **Networks & Servers card**: Changed from `bg-gradient-to-b from-muted/50 to-muted` to `backgroundColor: '#39301f'`
2. **Complete Protection card**: Changed from `bg-gradient-to-b from-muted/50 to-muted` to `backgroundColor: '#39301f'`
3. **Custom Development card**: Changed from `bg-gradient-to-b from-muted/50 to-muted` to `backgroundColor: '#39301f'`

## Impact Scope
- **Limited to**: Only the "Complete Technology Solutions" section on the main page
- **No collateral effects**: Other ASCII animations across the site remain unchanged
- **No global CSS changes**: Avoided modifying site-wide CSS variables

## Verification
The backup at `/Users/anibalin/Sites/anibal6/estela3/my-app-backup-viejo` confirmed `#39301f` was the correct color, as seen in the test pages with hardcoded background colors.

## Technical Details
The three ASCII animation components (`NetworksServersAsciiArt`, `AsciiWaveAnimation`, `DevelopmentAsciiArt`) all use `backgroundColor: 'transparent'`, so the container background was the source of the color issue.
