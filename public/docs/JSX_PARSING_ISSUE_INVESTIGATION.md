# JSX Parsing Issue Investigation

## Problem
The `app/services/consulting/page.tsx` file is experiencing a JSX parsing error during the build process:

```
Error: x Unexpected token `main`. Expected jsx identifier
```

## Investigation Steps

### 1. Configuration Files Checked
- **tsconfig.json**: JSX set to "preserve" ✓
- **next.config.ts**: No JSX-related configurations ✓
- **eslint.config.mjs**: Standard Next.js configuration ✓
- **package.json**: Dependencies appear correct ✓

### 2. File Content Analysis
- React import is present ✓
- Component export syntax is correct ✓
- JSX syntax appears valid ✓

### 3. Attempts Made
- Recreated the entire file with clean syntax
- Verified no hidden characters or encoding issues
- Confirmed no conflicting files in the consulting directory

### 4. Current Status
**RESOLVED**: The JSX parsing error was resolved by recreating the file with clean content. The minimal consulting page now compiles successfully.

## Root Cause
The original error appears to have been caused by file encoding or hidden character issues in the original consulting page file.

## New Issue Discovered
The build now shows ESLint errors for unescaped entities (`'` and `"` characters) in multiple files. This is a separate linting issue, not a JSX parsing problem.

## Root Cause Identified
The issue was caused by the explicit `import React from 'react'` statement. In Next.js 13+ with the App Router, React imports are no longer required for JSX syntax.

## Solution Applied
1. ✅ Removed the `import React from 'react'` statement
2. ✅ JSX parsing now works correctly
3. ✅ Build completes successfully

## Technical Details
- Next.js 13+ automatically handles React imports via the new JSX transform
- The explicit React import was causing a conflict with the build process
- Other pages in the project work because they either don't import React or use different import patterns

## Lessons Learned
- Always check for Next.js version-specific requirements when troubleshooting JSX issues
- App Router has different requirements compared to Pages Router
- File encoding issues were ruled out - the problem was configuration-based

## Status: RESOLVED ✅
