# Work Page Projects Update

**Date**: January 11, 2025  
**Updated By**: Claude Code  
**Affected Files**: 
- `/app/company/work/page.tsx`
- `/app/es/company/work/page.tsx`

## Overview

Replaced the existing project showcase data on the company work pages with three new real client projects and kept one placeholder for the fourth position.

## Changes Made

### 1. English Version Projects

Replaced the following projects:
- Hospital Network Infrastructure → Teatro Solis Theater A/V Control System
- Smart Manufacturing Platform → U Films Post-Production Infrastructure Build  
- Financial Services Security → Diagnostico Laboratory Data Security & Integration
- Cloud Migration & Modernization → (kept as placeholder)

### 2. Spanish Version Projects

Applied the same replacements with appropriate Spanish translations:
- Teatro Solís - Sistema de Control A/V del Teatro
- U Films - Construcción de Infraestructura de Post-Producción
- Diagnóstico - Seguridad e Integración de Datos de Laboratorio
- Migración y Modernización a la Nube (kept as placeholder)

## New Projects Details

### 1. Teatro Solis (Infrastructure, 3 months)
- **Challenge**: Legacy control systems couldn't handle modern lighting/sound requirements
- **Solution**: Networked lighting controls with touch panels and remote capabilities
- **Key Results**: 50% faster show setup, remote control capabilities, support for modern effects

### 2. U Films (Infrastructure, 12 months ongoing)
- **Challenge**: Building from scratch within network restrictions for major client security
- **Solution**: VPN solutions and parallel infrastructure design
- **Key Results**: Major client compatibility, 40% faster workflows, security compliance

### 3. Diagnostico (Infrastructure & Compliance, 3 years ongoing)
- **Challenge**: Medical lab needed secure data handling and ISO 9001 compliance
- **Solution**: Synology-based integration with automated backups
- **Key Results**: ISO 9001 achieved, 80% downtime reduction, 30% faster results

## Technical Notes

- Maintained the exact same data structure for compatibility with ProjectSection components
- Updated project IDs to match new client names (teatro-solis, u-films, diagnostico)
- Kept the fourth project slot with existing cloud migration project as placeholder
- All technologies arrays use proper formatting for the UI display
- Results maintain the checkmark format (✓) in the display

## Testing Recommendations

1. Verify both English and Spanish pages display correctly
2. Check that all project sections render with proper spacing
3. Ensure technology tags display correctly with proper styling
4. Confirm mobile responsiveness for the new content lengths
5. Test that the project images section (using generic images) still works

## Future Considerations

- The fourth project slot is currently using the old cloud migration project as a placeholder
- When the fourth project details are provided, update both language versions
- Consider adding project-specific images to replace the generic dithered images
- May want to update the hero section messaging to reflect the new project focus areas
