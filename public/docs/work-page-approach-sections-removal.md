2. `/app/es/company/work/page.tsx` (Spanish)

## Changes Completed
- ✅ Removed the WorkApproachList component import from both pages
- ✅ Removed the WorkProcessList component import from both pages
- ✅ Removed the usage of WorkApproachList component from both pages
- ✅ Removed the usage of WorkProcessList component from both pages
- ✅ Kept other sections intact (Hero, Project Images, Project Details, Final Section)

## Result
The "Our Approach" and "How We Work" sections have been successfully removed from both the English and Spanish work pages. The page structure now flows directly from Project Details to the Final Section.
